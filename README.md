Created a tabbar with two sections of the news list and favorites.

Made with async/await request to load with pagination of 10 news.

Used the News API.

I save them in the coreData, display them in the news list, when clicking on a cell from both lists, a detailed news screen opens, where you can add to favorites and delete.

Adding and deleting also occurs from the core data.

Used the MVC architecture, image caching, cleanliness and quality of the code.

Tested on different devices, displayed correctly.
